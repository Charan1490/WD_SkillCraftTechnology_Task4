ðŸŽ‰ Exciting News! ðŸŽ‰

I am thrilled to share that I have successfully completed my fourth (and final) task as a Web Development Intern at SkillCraftTechnology! ðŸš€

ðŸ’¼ For my last task, I developed a professional, fully responsive To-Do App with the following features:

Add, edit, and organize tasks
Set date and time for tasks
Mark tasks as completed
User-friendly interface with a modern design
Attractive background image for a polished feel
This project allowed me to further hone my skills in HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript, and I am excited about the continuous growth and learning I've experienced throughout this internship.

I would like to extend my gratitude to the team at SkillCraft Technology for this fantastic opportunity to learn and apply my skills in real-world projects! Looking forward to the next step in my web development journey!
